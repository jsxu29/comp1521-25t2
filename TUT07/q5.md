### Convert from decimal to floating point representation

Let's explore one way of doing this for 2.5:

1. Convert the whole number and decimal part to binary separately.

- 2 => 0b10

2. To convert the decimal part, continuously multiply only the decimal part by 2 and the whole number component are your resultant bits until you get 1.

- 0.5 * 2 = 1.0 

So we can write 2.5 as (10.1)<sub>2</sub>.

3. Now convert it to scientific notation form such that it has form

- 1.xxxx x 2<sup>e</sup>
- 2.5 => 1.01 x 2<sup>1</sup>

4. Convert it to bits

- sign is 0 if positive/zero or 1 if negative
- exponent is e + 127 in bits 
- mantisa/fraction would be the xxxx bits (filling it with 0s at the right to make 23 bits)

So for 2.5
- sign = 0b0
- exponent = 1 + 127 = 128 = 0b1000000
- mantisa = 0b01 0...0

<pre>
sign   exponent   fraction
0      10000000   01000000000000000000000
</pre>

b. Convert 0.375 into IEEE 754-encoded bit-strings

1. Convert the whole number and decimal part to binary separately.

- 0 => 0

2. To convert the decimal part, continuously multiply only the decimal part by 2 and the whole number component are your resultant bits.

- 0.375 * 2 = 0.75
- 0.75 * 2 = 1.5
- 0.5 * 2 = 1.0

So we can write 0.375 => (0.011)<sup>2</sup>.

3. Now convert it to scientific notation form such that it has form 1.xxxx x 2<sup>e</sup>

1.1 * 2<sup>-2</sup>

4. Convert it to bits

sign = 0 (positive)
exponent = -2 + 127 = 125 = 0b01111101
fraction = 0b100000...

Binary representation for 0.375 = 0b 0 01111101 1000000000...
