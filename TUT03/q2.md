# Data Segment

.text means run this code.

.data means place this in memory.

By default, assembly starts in .text.

Typically start with your code and put .data segment afterwards.

## Words

A word is a fixed-sized piece of data handled by the instruction set.

MIPS is a 32-bit architecture, meaning instructions and 
registers are all 32 bits long.

In MIPS, a word is 32 bits or 4 bytes long.

## Load / Store Architecture

MIPS is a load / store architecture.

To get something from memory, use:
- lw == load word # 32 bits == 4 bytes

To put something into memory, use:
- sw == store word # 32 bits == 4 bytes

## Question 2

If the data segment of a particular MIPS program starts at the address 0x10000020, then what addresses are the following labels associated with, and what value is stored in each 4-byte memory cell? 

```
    .data
a:  .word   42
b:  .space  4
c:  .asciiz "abcde"
    .align  2
d:  .byte   1, 2, 3, 4
e:  .word   1, 2, 3, 4
f:  .space  1
```

a:  .word   42 \
sizeof == 4 bytes \
addr == 0x10000020 \
a is stored at 0x10000020 to 0x10000020 + 4 (excluding 0x10000024) \
type == int


b:  .space  4 \
sizeof == 4 bytes \
addr == 0x10000020 + 4 == 0x10000024 \
b is stored at 0x10000024 to 0x10000024 + 4 (excluding 0x10000024) \
type == ???


> **Alignment:** 
 MIPS processor only likes to read multi-byte values from memory at an address that's a multiple of the data size. I.e., if we wanted to put a word at the next available address 0x1000002, MIPS would intentionally shift the value and leaves two bytes unused. To the next address that's a multiple of 4, 0x1000004. \
 <br />
The .ALIGN directive is a way to override the default alignment rules. The next field after the directive will be aligned to a multiple of 2 to the power of n where n is the .ALIGN value. I.e., .align 2 aligns it by pow(2, 2) = 4 bytes.


c:  .asciiz "abcde" 6 \
    .align  2
    # pads memory to nearest address divisible by 2^2 == 4 \
sizeof == 8 \
addr == 0x10000024 + 8 == 0x10000028 \
type = char[] 


d:  .byte   1, 2, 3, 4 \
sizeof == 
addr == 
type == 


e:  .word   1, 2, 3, 4 \
sizeof == 
addr == 
type == 


f:  .space  1 \
