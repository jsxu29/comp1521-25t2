## Array Address

Arrays are a contiguous block of memory. You're usually given a label that references the start of an array, and you have to figure out the offset from the start to get to an element. To calculate the offset, multiple the size of each element (in bytes) with the index.

address of array[i] = address of array + offset 
= address of array + i * sizeof(each array element)

int arr[5] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
&arr[0] = start of array
&arr[1] = start of array + space for arr[0] = start of array + 4
&arr[2] = start of array + space for arr[0] + space for arr[1] = start of array + 2 * 4


1) Find the number of bytes we need to offset inside the array.
Don't forget to consider the size of each array element.

i.e.
```
mul     $t1, <index>, 4 
```

2) Find the base address of the array

```
la     $t2, <array name> 
```

3) Add the offset to the base address

```
add     $t3, $t1, $t2
```

4) Store value at the calculated address

```
sw      <somewhere>, ($t3)
```
