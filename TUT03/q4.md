## Load / Store Insutrctions

- `lb`: load byte
- `lh`: load half word (2 bytes)
- `lw`: load word (4 bytes)
- `ld`: load double word (8 bytes)

All these instructions have a similar usage syntax. Let's use `lw` as our example since that's the most common one:

```mips
# General syntax
lw      $destinationRegister, address
```

Where `address` can be any of the following forms [here](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/25T1/resources/mips-guide.html#syntax) (see the 'address operand' table), and `$destination` is the register that you want to load data into.

## Addressing Modes

Summary:
- ($register) is an indirect reference, you get the value inside the () 
- a(b) == a + value inside register b
- label +/- a(b) == label + a + value inside register b

### `label`

```mips
lw      $t0, myVar
```

This will load a word starting from the label `myVar`. For example, if `myVar` is referencing address `0x10010000`, then the line above will load 4 bytes from `0x10010000` into `$t0`. Useful when you have to operate on a variable in memory that's referenced by a label.

### `($register)`

```mips
lw      $t0, ($t1)
```

This will load a word from the address stored inside `$t1`. The parentheses around `$t1` mean 'treat the value inside `$t1` as an address'. So, if `$t1` holds `0x10010004`, the instruction above will load 4 bytes from `0x10010004`. Useful when doing address calculations.

### `immediate($register)`

```mips
lw      $t0, -4($sp)
```

This will load a word from address (-4 + the value inside `$sp`). So, if `$sp` holds `0x10010004`, the instruction above will load 4 bytes from `0x10010000`. Useful for stack loads and stores.

### `label($register)`

```mips
lw      $t0, myArr($t1)
```

This will load a word from address (`myArr` + the value inside `$t1`), where `myArr` is a label. So, if `myArr` is at address `0x10010004` and `$t1` holds 8, then the instruction above will load 4 bytes from `0x1001000c`.

### `label +/- immediate`

```mips
lw      $t0, myArr + 8
```

This will load a word from address (`myArr` + 8), where `myArr` is a label. So, if `myArr` is at address `0x10010004`, the instruction above will load 4 bytes from `0x1001000c`.

### `label +/- immediate($register)`

```mips
lw      $t0, myArr + 8($t1)
```

This will load a word from address (`myArr` + 8 + the value inside `$t1`). So, if `myArr` is at address `0x10010004` and `$t1` holds 8, the instruction above will load 4 bytes from `0x10010014`.

## Storing Data into Memory

To store data, instead of using load instructions, we use store instructions like `sb`, `sh`, `sw`, and `sd`. The syntax for these instructions are the same as before, but note that the value to be saved COMES from the left and goes into the right which is the reverse of most instructions.

```mips
sw      $sourceRegister, address
```

## Examples

```
Address       Data Definition
0x10010000    aa:  .word 42
0x10010004    bb:  .word 666
0x10010008    cc:  .word 1
0x1001000C         .word 3
0x10010010         .word 5
0x10010014         .word 7
```

a. la   $t0, aa # la = load address
$t0 = address aa
$t0 = 0x10010000


b. lw   $t0, bb
$t0 = value at bb
$t0 = 666


c. lb   $t0, bb
one byte of 666 (which in bits is 0x0000029a)


d. lw   $t0, aa+4
aa + 4 = 0x10010000 + 4 = 0x10010004
$t0 = 666


e. la   $t1, cc
lw   $t0, ($t1)
$t1 = 0x10010008
$t0 = value at $t1 = value at 0x10010008 = 1


f. la   $t1, cc
lw   $t0, 8($t1)
$t1 = 
$t0 = 


g. li   $t1, 8
lw   $t0, cc($t1) // label($register) = label + value in register
$t1 = 
$t0 = 


h. la   $t1, cc
lw   $t0, 2($t1)
$t1 = 0x10010008
2($t1) = 2 + 0x10010008 = 0x1001000A // A = 10 in hexadecimal


NOTE: because this is a lw instruction, the address must be 4-byte aligned. Thus, executing this instruction will result in a memory alignment error.
