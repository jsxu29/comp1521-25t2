assignment 2 due week 10 friday, good luck! 
- check the forum for any questions, and get those free style marks :>

please fill out the myexperience survey!

in-person labs will be running practice exams, highly recommend you go to one to test out the environment, and double check what you have access to

exam tip:
- lots of functions to know, especially for file management and you learn more functions for threads/process management
- recommend you learn at least the name and vaguely what it does, and you can use the manual during the exam to figure out what it does
- man <look up term>
- man 3 is used in Linux in section 3 of the man pages. And section 3 refers to Library functions, covering in particular the C standard library, i.e. man 3 <func name> for standard library functions.
- man 2 is for section 2 system calls like open for files.

this week's content might feel quite disconnected but is a great intro into how programs actually run and what happens behind the scenes

# Threads and Processes

General motivation: the benefit of having programs is we can define how it should work and then run it autonomously. Currently we learnt how to write programs that run instructions sequentially. Could we make things better by writing code that runs at the same time? This may save a lot of time.

# Parallelism vs Concurrency

## Parallelism
- code that runs at the same time
- multiple resources to execute tasks simultaneously, making things faster

## Concurrency
- not necessarily at the same time
- run parts out of order without affecting the outcome
- managing multiple tasks efficiently with one resource

Parallelism - teamwork \
Concurrency - time management

## Processes
- An instance of a program running on the computer
- Different processes share a different memory space 
- Use posix_spawn to create a process

```
int posix_spawn(pid_t *restrict pid,
        const char *restrict path,
        const posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions,
        const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attrp,
        char *const argv[restrict],
        char *const envp[restrict]);
```

> pid_t *restrict pid - process id number

> const char *restrict path - path of the executable that we want to run

> const posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions - usually NULL

> const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attrp - usually NULL

> char *const argv[restrict] - array of command line arguments for the executable, last argument should be NULL to signify the end (like null terminators in strings)

> char *const envp[restrict] - environment variable

```
// extern means the variable is defined somewhere else.
// In this case, the variable is defined by the system environment.
extern char **environ;

pid_t pid;
int status = posix_spawn(&pid, path, NULL, NULL, argv[], environ);
if (status != 0) {
    perror("error in posix_spawn");
    exit(1);
}
```

- posix_spawn - requires the full path name of the executable
    - thread equivalent function - pthread_create
- posix_spawnp - same thing but searchs for the executable using the simple filename given
- Use waitpid to wait for the process to terminate and return a status value

## Threads
- A lightweight flow of control (runs code)
- #include <pthread.h>
- Like processes, use pthread_create to create a thread

```
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread,
        const pthread_attr_t *attr,
        void *(*start_routine)(void *),
        void *arg)
```

> pthread_t *thread - used to store the ID of the created thread

> const pthread_attr_t *attr - attributes (NULL for no attributes)

> void *(*start_routine)(void *) - function pointer \
> void * - can be type casted to a type

> void *arg - argument passed to start routine

- pthread_create
    - takes in a function pointer (void *(*start_routine)(void *))
    - function return type (void *) // pointer to function (*start_routine) // function argument (void *)

```
void *func(void *arg) {
    return NULL;
}
int status = pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, &func, thread_message);
if (status != 0) {
    perror("error in pthread_create");
    exit(1);
}
```

- Always error check
- Use pthread_join to wait for a thread to terminate

### Process vs Threads
- Processes can run one or many threads
- Processes can be run by multiple threads (helps us achieve parallelism/concurrency)
- You can have multiple threads that share the same memory and file descriptors etc


## Potential Errors - Data Race

Consider C operations in MIPS (q8_data_race.c looks at this).

### Atomic types
- atomic - smallest possible unit
- #include <stdatomic.h>
- don't need to keep in mind locks yourselves
- issues: only specific atomic operations allowed (i.e. only the smallest possible operations are allowed)

### Mutex locks
- create pthread_mutex_t objects that are specified to be locked or unlocked - if it is locked, can not be accessed in another thread
- create a mutex lock object - phread_mutex_t <lock_variable_name> = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER
- manipulate this lock object by locking and unlocking it - pthread_mutex_lock(&<lock_variable_name>) and pthread_mutex_unlock(&<lock_variable_name>)

## Potential Errors - Deadlock

multiple threads enter a waiting state because the resource/mutex lock is held by another waiting process
    - i.e. A waits on B and B waits on A :>
